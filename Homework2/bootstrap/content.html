        <h2><strong>Cavs-Warriors Game 7 the most heavily bet NBA game ever</strong></h2>
        </br><p>William Hill's Nevada sportsbook described the handle as "massive." It took three times more bets and three times the handle on Game 7 than it did on its most heavily bet game during the regular season (Golden State at Oklahoma City, Feb. 27).</p>
            Game 7 was responsible for 28 percent of all the money bet -- spread, total and money-line -- on the NBA Finals at William Hill.</p>

        <p> The Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook said the betting handle on Game 7 also was a record for its shop. And, three hours before tipoff, more than a million dollars had already been bet on Game 7 at MGM's sportsbooks.</p>

        <p> It wasn't just the volume that got the books' attention, but the size of the bets was also larger than normal. Six-figure bets -- normally scarce for the NBA Finals -- were reported by multiple books. MGM assistant manager Jeff Stoneback said
            the book took several six-figure bets, some on each team. He characterized the biggest bet as "large six figures" on the Cavs +5.</p>
        
        <p> "We've had more six-figure bets in two days on this game than sometimes we get in the first week or 10 days leading up to the Super Bowl," Stoneback told ESPN in a phone interview Sunday afternoon.</p>
        
        <p>Two seats to Game 7 sold for $49,500 each on Stubhub, a non-suite record in the site's 16-year history. It was also the most-watched NBA game since Game 6 of the 1998 Finals between the Utah Jazz and Chicago Bulls, according to ESPN business reporter Darren Rovell.</p>

        <p>While the handle was off the charts, the result -- Cleveland coming back from a 3-1 series deficit and winning Game 7 as a 4.5-point underdog -- wasn't ideal for some sportsbooks. The Westgate reported a small loss. Things were worse for Caesars.</p>

        <p>"When they tipped off, we knew that, if the Cavs won, we were going to get spanked pretty bad," Sattler, a Northeast Ohio native, said. He estimated the loss at roughly "4 percent" of the amount wagered.</p>

        <p> Down 3-1 after a Game 4 home loss, the Cavs could be found as high as 14-1 underdogs to win the series. MGM said it took close to 100 bets on Cleveland when it was down 3-1, with an average size bet around $250. Caesars also found plenty of support
            for the Cavaliers, despite them facing a deficit no team had ever overcome in the NBA Finals.</p>
